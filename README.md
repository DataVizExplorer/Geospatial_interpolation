# Geospatial interpolation of yield maps Jolanda Di Savoia plains
For this assignment, I have decided to use NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) to investigate the state of vegetation in the field. It is one of the most important and widely used indices for farmers to forecast and monitor yield.
## Data Frame:
The Dataframe is in GPKG format. GPKG is an open format for transferring geospatial information. It is an independent, self-describing, compact format. The GeoPandas library is used to read and write GPKG format files.
The prefix 'r' is used before a string in the code to indicate that itâ€™s a raw string. Raw strings clearly differentiate backslashes () and escape characters (used for things like \n for a new line). This practice is helpful to avoid issues when using Windows file paths, as they rely heavily on backslashes.
